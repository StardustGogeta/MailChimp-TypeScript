# MailChimp-TypeScript

A wrapper for the MailChimp v3.0 API, written in TypeScript 3.0.

This is largely based off of the [Python wrapper](https://github.com/charlesthk/python-mailchimp) for the API. Examples of usage can be found in the `/test` directory.

API calls are made using the [`request`](https://github.com/request/request) Node.JS package.
